# Installation

Managing your dotfiles in source control is important. This project uses [YADM](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/), a dotfile manager that employs git. With YADM you can start with a new repo, or clone an existing repo. Both approachs are explained in depth on the YADM website's [getting started](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/docs/getting_started) section. 

1. Download Antergos ISO
1. Fork this repo (or clone this repo directly and change it's upstream to your fork after install is done)
2. Install Arch using Antergos, choose the "no desktop environment" option, it is probably called "Base".
4. Follow the instructions outlined in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
5. report any bugs or manual steps as issues to this repo so that the install process can be improved.

## Debugging chron jobs

add "2>&1 |logger" to end of script: 

`* * * * * echo "test message" 2>&1 |logger`

then view the output:
`sudo systemctl status fcron`

## GTK

Custom themes are downloaded to `/usr/share/themes/`

Instructions for setting the GTK 2 & 3 themes can be found on the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK%2B#Themes)

Settings for gtk 3:
`~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`

Settings for gtk 2:
`~/.gtkrc-2.0`

## Cron Jobs

## Sending notifications to desktop

I use a notification daemon called [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst).
You can send notifications to the desktop using `dunstify` or `notify-send`

#### Getting Help

For help using these, in your terminal:

```
dunstify --help
notify-send --help
man dunst
```

#### Customise & Reload

Edit: `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc`

Reload: `killall dunst && notify-send foo`

Customize Dunst notifications via it's config file `~/.configs/dunst/dunstrc`

# Future Ideas

1. rust lib for creating rules for windows and workspaces in i3

examples of problems it could solve:

   * when opening a terminal, make it open with a fixed or relative height and width 
   * configure and restore workspace layouts, beyond the functionality of i3 

2. a polybar extension or stand alone application like rofi that provides a gui with functionality like emacs helm (spacemacs variety), to make common tasks, scripts, and functions discoverable and callable using symantic keybinds. (would love to use rust for the engine and maybe a language like lua, lisp, or python for scripting it)

3. short of the system variety of helm, a cheatsheet overlay that behaves like rofi and can hook into my config files and scripts to generate and display a cheatsheet would be amazing.

4. look into using taskwarrior for task management

5. look into using oh-my-zsh custom plugins for better management of .zshrc [oh-my-zsh wiki "Customization" section](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization)

6. +1 script to create issues in github repo for dotfiles from commandline using vim buffer (or maybe emacs plugin if i'm feeling ambitious.) 

7. rofi menu for selecting screen layout. Or maybe something other than rofi. My current i3 method is starting to reach it's limits.

8. refactor install script to be written in another language
probably python. move dependencies to list files. have core packages and non core packages. have commands to add and remove packages from both list files and os.

# Unanswered Questions

Things I want to know but didn't have time to look into when I thought of it.

- i3wm: How to move a window below the window to the right or left of it without moving it below
the entire tree

- how to do snippets in emacs (per mode would be really nice)
  
Some things I'd like snippets for:

  - Javascript console logs (figured this out once then promptly forgot how i did it)
  - argument parsing template for bash scripts (i always end up copy pasting from other scripts)
  - documentation templates for bash scripts (they're inconsistent between my scripts right now)
    
cli for browsing remote repos on account, as well as cloning and such
